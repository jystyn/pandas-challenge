This data set shows us the math and reading scores of students from various schools; these schools have a variety of sizes and are both charter and public. This allows us to compare how students perform within these circumstances and see what stands out.

According to this data, smaller schools outperform larger schools in math and reading scores. Obviously, a lot goes into these numbers, but smaller schools and class sizes should allow students to get more focused attention, thus improving their scores.

Charter Schools, even when large, greatly outperform public schools. Again, there are a lot of factors that go into this, but the data clearly shows an advantage to Charter schools with them occupying the top 5 scoring schools, while the bottom 5 are occupied by public schools.
